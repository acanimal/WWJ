Description:
------------
LayerSet allows create like tree of layers. It is a subclass of LayerList and also implements
the Layer interface, so you can create composite LayerSets. Example: 

MainLayer
 |
 |-- GroupA
 |      |-- IconLayer
 |      |-- RenderableLayer
 |
 |-- GroupB
        |-- ScalebarLayer
        |-- WorldmapLayer

Because it is a LayerList itself you can pass to any Model.

The operation setOpacity, setEnable, render and so on, makes changes interatively in all
its contained elements.

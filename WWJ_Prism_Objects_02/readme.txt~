Description:
------------
Prism object allow to render shaped from globe surface to the specified top elevation. You can render it 
in a wire or filled mode, change the fill or wire color (and transparency) and change the top elevation.
It is very useful for thematic maps.

This new version allows for Prism selection. Remeber in selection mode you can't interact with the globe.
Setting setPickEnable to false in the RenderableLayer where you put the Prism avoids this "problem".

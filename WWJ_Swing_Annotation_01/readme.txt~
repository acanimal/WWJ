Description:
------------
This is only an exercice trying to create better annotations using JWindows. This way we have all the 
power of Swing to create our annotations.

This version as a lot work to do. On the first place there is a different behaviour in Linux and Windows.
At leas in Linux (GNOME) the window annotations are not hidden when the main frame window is hidden. On
the other hand, in Windows (Vista) when the main window is hidden all window annotations are hidden too.

Also, there is a focus issue when you put a text box in the annotation window and you tryies to select it.


Changes from original WWJ 0.5.0:
--------------------------------
Any change on the original source code. All you need is to copy the files to the specified packages.

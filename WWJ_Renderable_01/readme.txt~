Description:
------------
Modified version of WWJ to adding more common methods to Renderable interface.
The idea is that every Renderable object has a 'render' method but also can
be enable (or not), can has a name and can has an opacity.

Also the Layer interface inherits (without any changes) from Renderable.

These new methods are:

    public boolean isEnabled();

    public void setEnabled(boolean enabled);

    public String getName();

    public void setName(String name);

    public double getOpacity();

    public void setOpacity(double opacity);

in addition to the original one:

    public void render(DrawContext dc);


Changes from original WWJ 0.3.0:
--------------------------------

This code add the previous methods to the Renderable interface, adds its implementation 
to all required code and add some new capabilities like take in account the icon or 
image opacity in the rendering process.

Modified classes are:

* gov.nasa.worldwind.render.Renderable.
* Added a default implementation on all affected objects.
* Created new class 'gov.nasa.worldwind.layers.RenderableListLayer', a modified version of LayerList
  that stores Renderable objects (Layer or some other Renderable implementation).
* Modified...

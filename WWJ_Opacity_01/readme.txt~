Description:
------------
This file describes the changes needed to allow modificable opacity in layers
based on TileImageLayer class.

The class SurfaceTileRenderer is responsible to render tiles of any tiled layer,
the problem is it doesn't take in account the layer opacity.
The idea is to add a reference, in the method responsible to render the tiles,
that points to the layer that contains the tiles to be drawn. Also I have
added code to set the opacity.

Finally it is necessary to modify all calls to this method on all layers
that calls it.

Changes from original WWJ 0.3.0:
--------------------------------

I have attached the modified files, but here are a brief descripcion of 
 changed respect WWJ 0.3.0:

* 'SurfaceTileRenderer.java'. On 'rederTiles' method, added a reference
  to the layer that contains the tiles. Then every tile can be rendered with
  the opacity specified in the layer:

  Change:
            public void renderTiles(DrawContext dc, Iterable<? extends SurfaceTile> tiles) ...
  by:
            public void renderTiles(DrawContext dc, Iterable<? extends SurfaceTile> tiles, AbstractLayer layer)...

  Also, after next code:

            ...
            gl.glActiveTexture(alphaTextureUnit);
            gl.glEnable(GL.GL_TEXTURE_2D);
            gl.glMatrixMode(GL.GL_TEXTURE);
            gl.glPushMatrix();
            gl.glTexEnvi(GL.GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL.GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL.GL_MODULATE);

  I have added:

            // Set opacity
            if (layer != null) {
                gl.glTexEnvi(GL.GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL.GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL.GL_MODULATE);
                gl.glColor4f(1, 1, 1, (float) layer.getOpacity());
            }
            ...

  Finally in the 'renderTile' method you need to add a reference to the owner layer
  and modify the call to 'renderTiles'.

  Change:
            public void renderTile(DrawContext dc, SurfaceTile tile) ...
  by:
            public void renderTile(DrawContext dc, SurfaceTile tile, AbstractLayer layer) ...

  And modify the call:
            this.renderTiles(dc, al);
  by:
            this.renderTiles(dc, al, layer);


* Finally, next is a list of files that must be modified to change the invokation 
  to the above methods 'renderTile' and 'renderTiles'. As example, in 
  TileImageLayer's 'draw' method you must change the call:

            dc.getGeographicSurfaceTileRenderer().renderTiles(dc, this.currentTiles);
  by:
            dc.getGeographicSurfaceTileRenderer().renderTiles(dc, this.currentTiles, this);

  to a reference to the owner layer to the SurfaceTileRenderer.

  List of modified classes, note that in SurfaceImage and SurfaceShape you must
  put a 'null' reference on the owner layer.

  - TileImageLayer.
  - RPFLayer.
  - SurfaceImage.
  - SurfaceShape.

* Added 'containsClass' method to query if some type of class is contained by the LayerSet or
  some of its possible contained LayerSets.

* Override method 'contains' to query if some object is contained by the LayerSet or some
  possible contained LayerList.

* Added 'indexOf' to know to index of the first object ocurrence of the given class. It only
  does a direct search in the current layer, doesn't search recursively.
